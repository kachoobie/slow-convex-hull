# Slow Convex Hull

Implementation of convex hull algorithm in O(n^3).

To run, clone the repo and install SDL3 and CMake. Python3.x is also required. Instructions for installing SDL3 from source are in [this repo](https://github.com/kachoobie/SDL3-setup-instructions). Once installed, run the Python compilation script:
```bash
python3 compile.py
```

Then, run the executable:
```bash
./exec.out
```

## Controls

Clicking anywhere on the window adds a point. Pressing the `space` key adds 10 random points. The `t` key adds 1000 random points. Pressing the `c` key clears the screen of all drawn objects. Pressing `return` finds the convex hull and presents it in the window.
